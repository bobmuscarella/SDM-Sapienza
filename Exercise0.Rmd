### Introduction

To prepare for the course, we will use some tutorials produced by the excellent Data Carpentry organization. Follow through the exercises below to refresh your general R skills and get you started with geospatial data and analyses. The 3rd lesson is optional; to complete it, you will need to [follow the setup page here](https://datacarpentry.org/geospatial-workshop/setup.html).


(You are free to skip around in these materials based on your prior knowledge but I encourage you to follow through everything)

2. [Data Carpentry: Introduction to Geospatial Concepts](https://datacarpentry.org/organization-geospatial/)
3. ***Optional:*** [Introduction to Geospatial Raster and Vector Data with R](https://datacarpentry.org/r-raster-vector-geospatial/)

<!-- # Getting started -->
<!-- ### Install and load R -->
<!-- * The R language can be downloaded from [R project website](https://www.r-project.org/). -->
<!-- * It is highly recommended to write and perform analyses in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/). -->
<!-- * RStudio allows you to create **projects** that keep all your work on a project together in a single folder. This helps enormously to keep your work organised and ideas together. To create a project for Ecological Methods: -->
<!--     + Click `File` -> `New project` -->
<!--     + In the window that opens click `New directory` then `New project` -->
<!--     + Enter a name for the project and the folder that will contain it, for example `SDM-course`, and the directory where you want that folder to be located. -->


<!-- ### Basic concepts -->
<!-- * **Functions** tell R to perform an action, and are always followed by round brackets. For example: -->
<!-- ```{r, eval=F} -->
<!-- c(1,2,3) # concatenate the numbers 1, 2 and 3 -->
<!-- mean(c(1,2,3)) # take the average of 1, 2 and 3 -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- * Functions take various **arguments** within the round brackets, that are separated by commas. -->
<!-- * We assign a name to data by using `<-` so we can use it later. For example: -->
<!-- ```{r, eval=F} -->
<!-- x <- c(1,2,3) -->
<!-- mean(x) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- * Square brackets are used to **subset** data. See the section on working with data for more... -->
<!-- * Sometimes we want to write **comments** for ourselves. The `#` symbol indicates that everything that follows on the same line is only a comment, and R should not try to evaluate it. -->
<!-- ```{r, eval=F} -->
<!-- # First concatenate the values -->
<!-- x <- c(1,2,3) -->
<!-- mean(x) # Then take the mean -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- ### Additional packages -->
<!-- * R has an enormous database of addition packages stored on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). -->
<!-- * Install a package using `install.packages`. For example, we will need the following package to import data from Excel files: -->
<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- install.packages('readxl') -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- * Once installed, you can load the package using `library`: -->
<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- library(readxl) -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- # Working with data -->
<!-- ### Working directory -->

<!-- * If you use an RStudio project, the working directory is automatically set to the project directory (this is the easy way to go!). -->
<!-- * When you import or export files, you specify their location relative to the working directory. -->
<!-- * You can find out what is your **current working directory** with: -->
<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- getwd() -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- * You can **change your working directory** by specifying a new path using something like: -->
<!-- ```{r, eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- setwd('~/Documents/SDM-course') -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- ### Other suggestions... -->
<!-- - Google it! Looking for help online is an integral part of modern coding. Any professional programmer who claims not to do this regularly is lying to you. -->
<!-- - All R functions should have documentation that you can access by typing `help(x)` or `?x`, where `x` is a function name. -->
<!-- - The [quick R website](https://www.statmethods.net/) has some excellent and brief tutorials on the most important topics. -->
<!-- - Hadley Wickham's book 'R for Data Science' provides a very gentle guide from the very basics to running your own analysis. You can read it for free at [here](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/). -->
