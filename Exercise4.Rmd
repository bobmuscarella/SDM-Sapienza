### Introduction

In this exercise, you will:

- Use [`ENMeval`](https://jamiemkass.github.io/ENMeval/index.html) to build and evaluate Maxent SDMs
- Get familiar with the [ODMAP (Overview, Data, Model, Assessment and Prediction) protocol)](https://odmap.wsl.ch/)

$~$

### Part 1: Model evaluation with `ENMeval`

In this exercise, we will work through the new [`ENMeval` vignette](https://jamiemkass.github.io/ENMeval/articles/ENMeval-2.0-vignette.html). Before beginning, you should download the development version of the package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("jamiemkass/ENMeval")
```

You can read more about the [latest version of the ENMeval package in this paper](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13628).

### Part 2: ODMAP protocol

Recently, the ODMAP protocol (Overview, Data, Model, Assessment and Prediction) was introduced by [Zurell *et al.* (2020)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecog.05700) as a way to ensure quality and repeatability of SDMs.

There is a web app to complete this protocol here: [https://odmap.wsl.ch/](https://odmap.wsl.ch/)

For this exercise, complete [the ODMAP protocol on the web app](https://odmap.wsl.ch/) using information from one of the previous R exercises (or just invent an example).  You do not necessarily need to complete all the fields - the aim is to become familiar with the type of information included in the form, and to view a completed version.
