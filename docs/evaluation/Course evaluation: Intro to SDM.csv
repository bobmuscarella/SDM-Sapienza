It's easier to follow a teacher performing an exercise and then repeating it instead of just tackling it by following written instructions."

Of course I don't feel expert in this domain yet and I would probably need to work more on it to feel comfortable at actually using a SDM in a project, but I do feel capable to learn these topics more in depth and I feel like this is really attainable. Maybe going over a full scientific article that uses SDM correctly could be interesting to better visualize the methods that are used in practice and how to interpret the results."

I would say one in variable selection, background points and extent, algorithm selection, and evaluation would be really good as a general approach. Also valid to say that the approach to a flexible use of time is really good! Overall I found the course really useful. Thanks!"
