### Introduction
This course was initially developed as a 3-day workshop at Sapienza University in June, 2021. Students have various options to work through at their own pace, following different specific lessons based on their prior knowledge and goals.

**Learning objectives**: In general, by the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Know the basic theory and concepts behind SDMs / ENMs
- Design, build and evaluate SDMs / ENMs using automated R scripts
- Understand the strengths and limitations of SDMs / ENMs for different purposes
- Use SDMs / ENMs to describe, predict, and project species distributions in space and time

### Before the course

**Reading**

Please read these papers before the course begins as they provide important background information.  We will discuss them on Day 1 of the course.

- [Elith, J., & Leathwick, J. R. (2009). Species distribution models: ecological explanation and prediction across space and time. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 40, 677-697.](pdfs/Elith and Leathwick 2009.pdf)
- [Elith, J., & Graham, C. H. (2009) Do they? How do they? WHY do they differ? On finding reasons for differing performances of species distribution models. Ecography 32(1), 66-77.](pdfs/Elith and Graham 2009.pdf)
- [Merow et al. (2014) What do we gain from simplicity versus complexity in species distribution models? Ecography, 37, 1267â€“1281.](pdfs/Merow et al. 2014.pdf)


**R Exercises**

To prepare for the course, we will use some tutorials produced by the excellent Data Carpentry organization. Follow through the exercises below to refresh your general R skills and get you started with geospatial data and analyses. You are free to skip around in these materials based on your prior knowledge but I encourage you to follow through everything.

1. [Data Carpentry: Introduction to R and RStudio](https://datacarpentry.org/r-intro-geospatial/01-rstudio-intro/index.html)
2. [Data Carpentry: Introduction to Geospatial Concepts](https://datacarpentry.org/organization-geospatial/)
3. ***Optional:*** [Introduction to Geospatial Raster and Vector Data with R](https://datacarpentry.org/r-raster-vector-geospatial/). To complete this exercise, you will first need to [follow the setup instructions](https://datacarpentry.org/geospatial-workshop/setup.html).

*Note: If you are very new to R and want a more detailed introduction, I recommend:* [Data Carpentry: Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/index.html). *Note that going through this entire exercise will take about one full day.*
