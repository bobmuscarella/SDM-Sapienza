### **Introduction**

**Learning objectives**: By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Know the basic theory and concepts behind SDMs / ENMs
- Design, build and evaluate SDMs / ENMs using automated R scripts
- Understand the strengths and limitations of SDMs / ENMs for different purposes
- Use SDMs / ENMs to describe, predict, and project species distributions in space and time

### **Day 0**: Before the course

**Reading**: Please read these papers before the course begins as they provide important background information.  We will discuss them on Day 1.

- [Elith, J., & Graham, C. H. (2009) Do they? How do they? WHY do they differ? On finding reasons for differing performances of species distribution models. Ecography 32(1), 66-77.](pdfs/Elith and Graham 2009.pdf)
- [Elith, J., & Leathwick, J. R. (2009). Species distribution models: ecological explanation and prediction across space and time. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 40, 677-697.](pdfs/Elith and Leathwick 2009.pdf)
